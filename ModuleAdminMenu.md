# Purpose #

> The Admin Menu module adds various Ultimate Mapchooser abilities to the SourceMod Admin Menu. Specifically, it gives admins the ability to change the current map, set the next map, and run a map vote. This module is a good starting point for configuring Utimate Mapchooser because it gives administrators the ability to quickly test various settings, as well as their UMC-Mapcycle.

Real documentation for this module is coming soon.
